# Next.js front for Wordpress / Woocommerce.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description
The task was to create a Next.js fromntend application for existing e-commerce store, saving the existing processing workflow and streamlining customers shopping experience with faster selection and checkout process. Product cards created as popups instead of pages to reduce unnessery navigation. Working on this project I learned a great deal of new things:
- GraphQL and REST Wordpress/Woocommerce APIs;
- payment providers integration (Paypal and Stripe), including Next.js webhooks for handling status changes;
- deployment of application with Docker and Apache reverse proxy.

## Stack
